PRIMM Activity: Counting Candy with Python FOR Loops
Scenario: You and your friend went trick-or-treating and got a huge bag of candy on Halloween! 
Let's write some Python code to help us figure out how much candy each person gets.


Check out the following code snippet:

candy_list = ["Snickers", "Twix", "Butterfinger", "Starburst", "Gummi Bears"]
total_candy = 0

for candy in candy_list:
    # What will happen inside this for loop?




********** PREDICT **********

1. Write down your prediction of what the code will output (display).  How many candies will it count?



********** RUN **********

1. Run your starter script in VS Code and see what happens.  Did your prediction match the actual output (results)?  Why or why not?


********** INVESTIGATE **********

1. Let's break down the code. What does the line for candy in candy_list: do?


2. What happens inside the loop (the indented block) each time the loop runs (loops)?


3. Explain what the variable total_candy is used for in the loop.
